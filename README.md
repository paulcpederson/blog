## Install

```
npm install
```

## Development

```
npm run dev
```

## Deploy

There are two droplets that can be pushed to. I've named them dokku (production) and dev (development). To deploy to dev, use:

```
npm run deploy
```

To deploy to production, just pass in the production branch name:

```
npm run deploy -- dokku
```
