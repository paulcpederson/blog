      <section class="constrain content"><p>If you’ve used GitHub releases you know how great they can be. Essentially you draft a new release on any of your GitHub repositories, choose a specific tag, enter a title and a description, and click a button to create a neat and tidy little package that users can download and use.</p>
<p>Recently I realized that creating these releases was one of the only things I was doing by hand, and that seemed inefficient, so I endeavored to solve the problem with Grunt. It was all very easy with Grunt plugins that were already written, but there were a couple gotchas, so I thought I’d write it up for future generations.</p>
<h2 id="grunt-compress">Grunt Compress</h2>
<p>First, you create a zip file that people looking at your
GitHub release can download using <a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-compress">grunt-contrib-compress</a>. This is super straightforward. Install it: <code>npm install --save-dev grunt-contrib-compress</code>, then load and configure it in <code>Gruntfile.js</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">compress: {
  main: {
    options: {
      archive: <span class="string">'name.zip'</span> <span class="comment">// What you want to call your file</span>
    },
    files: [
      {
        src: [<span class="string">'dist/**'</span>], <span class="comment">// What should be included in the zip</span>
        dest: <span class="string">'./'</span>        <span class="comment">// Where the zipfile should go</span>
      },
    ]
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>It’s probably a good idea to add <code>name.zip</code> (or whatever you end up naming your file) to your <code>.gitignore</code> so you aren’t tracking checking it into git.</p>
<h2 id="grunt-github-releaser">Grunt GitHub Releaser</h2>
<p>The most important plugin to use was obviously <a href="https://github.com/dolbyzerr/grunt-github-releaser">grunt-github-releaser</a>. I chose this one, but there are a myriad of grunt plugins that handle creating releasing on GitHub and any would probably work. This handles almost all of the heavy-lifting for you in terms of creating a GitHub release. A sample would be something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js"><span class="string">'github-release'</span>: {
  options: {
    repository: <span class="string">'yourName/repo-name'</span>,
    release: {
      tag_name: <span class="string">'v1.0.0'</span>,
      name: <span class="string">'v1.0.0'</span>,
      body: <span class="string">'Description of the release'</span>
    }
  },
  files: {
    src: [<span class="string">'name.zip'</span>]
  }
},
</code></pre>
<p>Now what you should be thinking in your head is “I would have to change all of these settings every signle time I create a release!”. Let’s fix that. First, use the version number in your <code>package.json</code> as your tag and title:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js"><span class="string">'github-release'</span>: {
  options: {
    repository: <span class="string">'yourName/repo-name'</span>,
    release: {
      tag_name: grunt.file.readJSON(<span class="string">'package.json'</span>).version,
      name: grunt.file.readJSON(<span class="string">'package.json'</span>).version,
      body: <span class="string">'Description of the release'</span>
    }
  },
  files: {
    src: [<span class="string">'name.zip'</span>]
  }
},
</code></pre>
<p>Now all that’s left is the body (description) of the release. I have been just parsing this from my <code>CHANGELOG.md</code>, but there are numerous ways to handle that.</p>
<h2 id="grunt-prompt">Grunt Prompt</h2>
<p>The final step is to sign in to GitHub with your username and password so you can upload a release. The grunt-github-releaser plugin has an <code>auth</code> object where you can put your username and password, but that should <strong>terrify</strong> you because then your password would be in plaintext in a (maybe public) GitHub repo…</p>
<p>I solved this problem using <a href="https://github.com/dylang/grunt-prompt">grunt-prompt</a>. This lets us ask for a username and password when the grunt task is run. After you npm install and load the grunt task, configure prompt like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">prompt: {
  target: {
    options: {
      questions: [
        {
          config: <span class="string">'github-release.options.auth.user'</span>, <span class="comment">// set the user to whatever is typed for this question</span>
          type: <span class="string">'input'</span>,
          message: <span class="string">'GitHub username:'</span>
        },
        {
          config: <span class="string">'github-release.options.auth.password'</span>, <span class="comment">// set the password to whatever is typed for this question</span>
          type: <span class="string">'password'</span>,
          message: <span class="string">'GitHub password:'</span>
        }
      ]
    }
  }
},
</code></pre>
<p>This will set the values of grunt-github-releaser to be whatever the user enters in the prompt. You could even add a prompt for a release body here if you don’t have a way of getting that yet!</p>
<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h2>
<p>Now, you would just register a grunt task that runs these plugins in the right order and give it a sensible name like, I don’t know, <code>release</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">grunt.registerTask(<span class="string">'release'</span>, [
  <span class="string">'prompt'</span>,
  <span class="string">'compress'</span>,
  <span class="string">'github-release'</span>
]);
</code></pre>
<p>Now you can just use <code>grunt release</code>. Enter your username and password and you’re done!</p>
<p>As always, if this makes no sense, is wrong, or could be improved, you should tweet at me: <a href="https://twitter.com/paulcpederson">@paulcpederson</a>.</p>
