## Origins

When I joined Esri more than three years ago there was no official design language or web style guide. Esri is a large organization, with partners all over the world, offices in several countries, and thousands of web properties, so without an official set of interface components and visual styles you can imagine what was happening. Teams were reinventing the same wheel fourteen times, and none of them looked or worked the same. As a user, navigating through all of these sites was difficult. Tabs worked one way on this site, and another way on that site. From a brand perspective, most teams hadn't read the official brand style guide, which meant that as a brand, Esri felt chaotic and confusing.

I was tasked with developing a CSS framework that could codify these design decisions and make it easy to create an Esri branded website. Teams around the world could copy and paste patterns and components to quickly build sites that they knew would be lightweight, consistent, and beautiful. As teams move their existing sites over to Calcite Web, Esri's web presence slowly becomes better and better with each migration.

## Design

Esri had a very lengthy brand style guide (we're talking ninety-seven pages) which defined everything from letterheads to email signatures. Conceptually, this framework would need to be an extension of those ideas.

A great deal of work had also recently gone into redesigning [ArcGIS Pro]
(http://www.esri.com/en/software/arcgis-pro), Esri's relatively new desktop GIS offering. They had developed an extensive set of guidelines for icons, color, and interface concepts. They called these design ideas "Calcite".

Our design would have to be consistent with both of these documents
