## Hi, I'm Paul.

I design and develop digital experiences. I work at a research and development office in Portland, Oregon focused on location-based technologies. You can find me online just about everywhere as @paulcpederson.

This site was built using [Wintersmith](https://github.com/jnordberg/wintersmith), and is hosted on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) with [Dokku](https://github.com/progrium/dokku). You can find the source on [my GitHub](https://github.com/paulcpederson/).
